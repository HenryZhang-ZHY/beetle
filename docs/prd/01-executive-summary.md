# Executive Summary - Beetle Code Search PRD

## Product Vision

Beetle is a next-generation source code indexing and search tool designed to provide lightning-fast, intelligent code search across large codebases. Built with Rust and leveraging the Tantivy search engine, Beetle aims to become the go-to solution for developers who need to navigate, understand, and explore complex codebases efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Modern software development faces several critical challenges when it comes to code discovery and navigation:

- **Scale**: Codebases are growing exponentially, making traditional grep-based search inadequate
- **Performance**: Existing tools struggle with performance on large repositories (>1M files)
- **Intelligence**: Basic text search lacks semantic understanding and context awareness
- **Multi-interface**: Developers need consistent search experience across CLI, IDE, and web interfaces
- **Real-time**: Code changes frequently, requiring near real-time indexing updates

## Solution Overview

Beetle addresses these challenges through:

1. **High-Performance Indexing**: Rust-based indexing engine using Tantivy for sub-second search across millions of files
2. **Multi-Platform Support**: CLI, VS Code extension, and web interface with consistent UX
3. **Smart Search**: Advanced query capabilities including regex, fuzzy matching, and code-aware tokens
4. **Real-time Updates**: Incremental indexing to keep search results current
5. **Developer-Friendly**: Zero-configuration setup with sensible defaults

## Target Market

### Primary Users
- **Software Engineers**: Individual developers working on medium to large codebases
- **DevOps Engineers**: Managing infrastructure-as-code and deployment scripts
- **Technical Leads**: Exploring unfamiliar codebases and conducting code reviews
- **Open Source Contributors**: Navigating large open-source projects

### Secondary Users
- **Security Researchers**: Analyzing code for vulnerabilities and patterns
- **Data Scientists**: Exploring codebases for ML model training data
- **Technical Writers**: Researching code for documentation purposes

## Key Value Propositions

1. **Speed**: 10-100x faster than traditional grep-based search on large codebases
2. **Scale**: Handles repositories with 10M+ files efficiently
3. **Intelligence**: Code-aware search that understands programming languages
4. **Flexibility**: Multiple interfaces (CLI, IDE, Web) for different workflows
5. **Simplicity**: Zero-config setup with powerful defaults

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Beetle Advantage |
|------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| ripgrep | Fast, regex support | No indexing, no UI | Persistent indexing + UI |
| Sourcegraph | Powerful, enterprise features | Complex setup, expensive | Simple setup, open source |
| GitHub Search | Integrated with GitHub | Limited to GitHub repos, slow | Local-first, faster |
| VS Code Search | Integrated with editor | Slow on large repos | Optimized for scale |
| OpenGrok | Mature, feature-rich | Java-based, resource-heavy | Rust-based, lightweight |

## Business Impact

### For Individual Developers
- **Time Savings**: Reduce code navigation time by 70-90%
- **Learning Acceleration**: Faster onboarding to new codebases
- **Bug Discovery**: Quicker identification of relevant code patterns

### For Teams
- **Collaboration**: Shared indexes for team knowledge
- **Code Review**: Faster PR reviews with intelligent search
- **Documentation**: Living documentation through searchable code

### For Organizations
