## Quick Start

For new contributors and stakeholders, start with:
1. **Executive Summary** - Understand the product vision and market opportunity
2. **User Personas** - Learn about our target users and their needs
3. **Technical Architecture** - Get familiar with the system design

## Development Process

We follow a **document-first development process**:
1. **Design** - Requirements and architecture documented in PRD
2. **Review** - Stakeholder review and approval of specifications
3. **Implement** - Development based on approved specifications
4. **Validate** - Testing against defined success metrics
5. **Iterate** - Continuous improvement based on feedback and metrics

## Feedback and Updates

PRD updates should be driven by:
- **User feedback** from all interfaces (CLI, VS Code, Web)
